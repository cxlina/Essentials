**NOTE:** Some people asked me if my mods work on Quilt, or if i will port them over if not.

The answer is easy: NO.

Why? Quilt is something i don't want to support myself. It's one of those "It exists just to exist" projects, where i don't see any reason for it to exist.
In terms of development, there's no big changes from fabric, and all changes that exist don't make any sense in my opinion, and/or could easily be included in fabric. but no, they had to "reinvent the wheel".

So in short: if my mods work on quilt, cool. you can obviously use them.
If they don't, you're on your own.

This is a mod with Bugfixes and Un-Patches Mojang doesn't care about.
